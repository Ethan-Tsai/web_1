            Today I came to Kaohsiung for a day trip near Sun Yat-sen University. Breakfast is indispensable in a beautiful morning. Our breakfast choice is the 40-year-old wharf omelet. The special old-fashioned flour omelette tastes soft and fragrant , the omelette
            is thick and full of weight, and watching the aunt struggling to fry the powder in the big pot is also very healing. The next stop we come to the Pier-2 Art Zone. The Pier-2 Art Zone has three main parts, namely Dayong Warehouse and Penglai
            Warehouse And the Dayi Warehouse, each has different characteristics, but the same level of excitement, although the Pier 2 Pagoda of the Dayong Warehouse looks different It is high, but the landscape above is breath-taking. The port, Cijin
            and the 85th Building are all in sight. The installation art of the Penglai installation also floats in my mind. The oversized suitcases, speakers and robots are all impressive. I find it novel, and the installation art of Dayi Warehouse called
            Peeing Boy is made of mosaic collage walls and faucets. The faucets spray water from time to time. I didn’t know that I was almost sprayed when I took pictures. These three are my refutation 2 The impression of the Art Special Zone is that
            the Pier-2 Special Zone is very large, and you can spend half a day visiting it. You can eat Wanquan Meatballs at noon. This restaurant has been in business for 60 years. It is cheap and delicious. The meatballs are soft and sticky but not
            bad. The store makes its own sauce and garlic, and the overall taste is even better. The rice cake is Q-bomb. After eating enough, I went to the nearby Fuquan Snowflake Ice Shop to eat ice to cool off the heat. After filling my stomach, I
            first came to the secret place of Chaishan. A section of the road is considered a small exercise after dinner. After arriving, it seems to have come to a paradise. It has not been contaminated by the world at all. The beauty of nature, strange
            rocks, a straight coastline and the endless sea, how wonderful it would be to live in this place, It's a pity that the people around me brought me back to reality in an instant. All in all, when you come near Sun Yat-sen University, you must
            visit the secret place of Chaishan. Later, we went to the residence of the British Consulate in Dagou. As the first residence of a foreign consulate in Taiwan, the overall building has a long history. , but the design is excellent, there is
            afternoon tea to drink, so we drank fruit tea and enjoyed the sunset of Xiziwan, and had Chaoyue cold noodles for dinner, delicious Korean cuisine, summed up the day is quite fulfilling, if there is a chance, I hope Learn more about the area.
